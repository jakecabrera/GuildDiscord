	[&guild get missing]
# To get the ids of the roles in this discord
	[&get role ids]
# Greetings
	[&greeting] Returns the current greeting for this server if 
		this command is used alone, otherwise, 
		anything written in that message below the 
		command line becomes the greeting.
	[&greeting channel (channel_mention)] If a channel is 
		mentioned, bind the greeting to that channel, 
		otherwise return the currently bound channel.
	[&greeting delay (delay amount in seconds)] If a delay 
	    amount is specified, set the delay of the 
		greeting message, otherwise return the current 
		delay amount. Delays can be as small as 0s 
		and as large as 60s(why tho?).

```CSS
<ADDED> discord_name#1234 [bdo_family_name] 
<REMOVED> discord_name#1234 [bdo_family_name] 
<LEFT> discord_name#1234 [bdo_family_name] 

The above are the ones Herbert officially recognizes so far. so basically you state in angle brackets '<>' what is happening, then you put their discord name with the discriminator (the numbers that follow the name), and then you put the bdo *family* name in square brackets '[]'. 

If you are adding someone to the guild and for some weird reason you don't know their discord name, it is **okay** to omit the discord name as so: 
<ADDED> [bdo_family_name] 

If they have a cool down, can't join just yet, or is added as a friendo for any reason, the format is as follows: 
<FRIENDO (reason why friendo)> discord_name#1234 [bdo_family_name] 
example: 
<FRIENDO 24h COOLDOWN> sarge841#8833 [Aeldrelm] 

With friendo, a lot of the times you won't know the bdo family name when friendoing. In those cases, omitting the bdo family name is **okay**. Like so: 
<FRIENDO> sarge841#8833 []
```
